Don't build tools, just libpng:

======================

In libpng/libpng_read_fuzzer.cc
added PNG_CLEANUP macro and invoked it 4 places
(in setjmp blocks and at final return).

======================

Attempted to run the fuzzer locally as suggested
in ... with

clang++ -g -fsanitize=address -fsanitize-coverage=trace-pc-guard \
  libpng_read_fuzzer.cc libFuzzer.a
./a.out

but it couldn't find liibFuzzer.a.  It seems that my clang
is too old because libFuzzer.a is supposed to be included
in clang versions > 20 April 2017.

======================

So I ran apt-get dselect-upgrade clang
but it appears to be upgrading everything.
It took nearly an hour, but didn't change
clang or clang++ from version 3.8.0

======================

Tried removing the unrecognized -fsanitize-coverage option
but then the compiler complains about nullptr which is
where I was the other day trying to compile the target
manually.

======================

Went to the clang web site. Apparently the required version
is 4.0.1, July 2017 (4.0.0 is prior to 20 April). 4.0.0
is available for Ubuntu, 4.0.1 is not, so I downloaded the
Debian-8 version.

======================

Looks good:

studio> /home/glennrp/Clang/clang+llvm-4.0.1-x86_64-linux-gnu-debian8/bin/clang --version
clang version 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)
Target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /home/glennrp/Clang/clang+llvm-4.0.1-x86_64-linux-gnu-debian8/bin

======================

But, it still doesn't like the "nullptr" in  libpng_read_fuzzer.cc:

libpng_read_fuzzer.cc:27:22: warning: in-class initialization of non-static data
      member is a C++11 extension [-Wc++11-extensions]
  png_infop info_ptr = nullptr;
                     ^
and a dozen similar messages

======================

Copied the 
/home/glennrp/Clang/clang+llvm-4.0.1-x86_64-linux-gnu-debian8/*
into /usr, so "clang++ --version" reports

clang version 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)
Target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /usr/bin

======================

But, it still doesn't like the "nullptr" in  libpng_read_fuzzer.cc.

======================

Changed local-run.sh to add "-std=c++11":

  clang++ -std=c++11 -I. -lz -I/usr/include \
  -fsanitize=address -fsanitize-coverage=trace-pc-guard \
  libpng_read_fuzzer.cc -libFuzzer.a
  ./a.out

This still can't find libFuzzer.a (I can't find it anywhere either; I
thought it was supposed to be part of Clang).
