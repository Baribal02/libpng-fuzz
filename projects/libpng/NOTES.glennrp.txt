======================

in libpng/build.sh

disable libpng WARNING:

+cat scripts/pnglibconf.dfa | \

Don't build tools, just libpng:
-make -j$(nproc) all
+make -j$(nproc) libpng16.la

======================

In libpng/libpng_read_fuzzer.cc
added PNG_CLEANUP macro and invoked it 4 places
(in setjmp blocks and at final return).

======================

Attempted to run the fuzzer locally as suggested
in ... with

clang++ -g -fsanitize=address -fsanitize-coverage=trace-pc-guard \
  libpng_read_fuzzer.cc libFuzzer.a
./a.out

but it couldn't find liibFuzzer.a.  It seems that my clang
is too old because libFuzzer.a is supposed to be included
in clang versions > 20 April 2017.

======================

So I ran apt-get dselect-upgrade clang
but it appears to be upgrading everything.
It took nearly an hour, but didn't change
clang or clang++ from version 3.8.0

======================

Tried removing the unrecognized -fsanitize-coverage option
but then the compiler complains about nullptr which is
where I was the other day trying to compile the target
manually.
