# Integration rewards

We encourage you to apply for integration rewards (up to **$20,000**) once your project
is successfully integrated with OSS-Fuzz. Please see the details in our blog post
[here](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2017/05/oss-fuzz-five-months-later-and.html).

Note that the biggest rewards are issued to projects that satisfy both of the following
criteria:
* The project is of a critical importance for the global infrastructure and/or widely
  used products, devices, or services.
* The quality of the project integration with OSS-Fuzz satisfies all the considerations
  outlined in the blog post linked above.

The actual reward amounts are at the discretion of the OSS-Fuzz rewards panel.
